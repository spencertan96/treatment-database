# Treatment Database
A Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application to track patient treatments. 

Users can log their treatment records into the application and search for similarities between different treatments. 

The application also analyses the data and highlights patterns based on it.

## Features
- Tracking of treatment records
    - Each record consists of a `Name`, a `Date`, a `Diagnosis`, up to 6 `Symptoms`, up to 6 `Treatments`, a treatment `Effectiveness` (Ineffective, unsure or effective) and `Notes` 
- Searching through the database for specific records using filters
- Analysis on stored data such as the most common diagnosis for a certain symptom, frequency of different diagnoses or common symptoms for certain diagnoses

## To try the application:
1. Click on the green `Code` button at the top right of the page, then `Download as ZIP`
2. Extract the downloaded files into a folder
3. Run `treatment_database.application`

Any future updates will be automatically detected when `treatment_database.application` is run.
